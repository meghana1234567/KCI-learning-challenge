review the applicaton manually and identify the entry points and client side code and also classify the third party code.


Authorization:

check the applicaton for the traversal,vertical and horizontal access control issues,ssing authorization and insecure,direct object reference.


Cryptography:

Cryptography makes the code more stronger and it can encrypted by using specific algorithms.


Denial of service(dos):

Denial of service helps as a protection against threats to the web application to make it more secure,but it can not protect against high volume DOS or DDOS attacks.
   

Some ore efficient ways to protect our web applcation are:

DDOS protection:

This service offer a blankt protection against all network layers and applications ddos attacks.


Bolt filterng:

Malicious bolts are used in mass scale automated assaults and it is a free service that uses advanced client classification,and it also keep monitoring the client traffic.
